Communication in Work Settings
Spring 2025 – Tuesday, 6:00 – 8:50 pm
Course Description
Communication in Work Settings is a master’s level course focusing on internal communication topics (e, g., manager-employee and peer communication). Equal emphasis is placed on theoretical understanding and practical applications. A strong theoretical foundation is required to ensure that decisions about communication practices are based on sound research rather than popularized myths. That is, how is a concept studied by academicians and why do we want to build/test theories about the concept? Concomitantly, how is the concept treated by practitioners and consultants? Your current and future employers are counting on you to be able to collect and evaluate the most recent research about topics relevant to your profession.Module 1: History Organizational Communication and Organizational Structures·   The Foundations of Organizational Communication·   Organizational StructureModule 2: Organizational Culture and Socialization·   Organizational Culture·   Socialization, Organizational Entry  ExitModule 3: Information Exchange, Leadership and Delegation·   Task Feedback and Delegation·   Dissent   Module 4: Destructive Workplace Communication:    Incivility and Bullying·   When Bad Things Happen to Good People: Destructive Organizational RelationshipsTextbookSpaulding, S.

Course Learning Outcomes
Topics have been selected because of their importance in shaping how people communicate with each other in organizations and how that impacts organizational outcomes such as productivity, satisfaction, innovation, and competitiveness. That is, the topics will help you understand how your performance is positively or negatively affected by your communication encounters.·   Identify the behaviors and artifacts of distinct organizational cultures/subcultures and how they affect communication in diverse workplaces.·   Review and assess the value of applied materials for your potential audiences.·   Delegate (or receive delegation) in a manner that enables the production of high quality, cost effective products.·   Provide information to newcomers to facilitate their organizational entry.·   Identify destructive workplace behaviors and know the intervention options available in one’s organization.·   Learn how to be agile with your communication skills so that you are comfortable moving between theoretical and applied material.

Late assignments may receive lower grades.    With the exception of submission due during the final exam period, I can typically allow up to a 48-hour extension – but after that a grade penalty should be expected.
